# Genetic_Algorithm 

This repository is used for genetic algorithm problem 
## Senario
Try to solve a basic optimization problem, here is the problem. 
- A van in a shop must be filled to transport household appliances, its load must be optimized by maximizing the value of what is transported for a given volume. We have a file with occupied space, price and quantity of certain products in here https://github.com/Danu-B/Genetic_Algorithm-/tree/main/data 
- The algorithm and the solution is found in https://github.com/Danu-B/Genetic_Algorithm-/blob/main/scripts/geneticAlgo.py
